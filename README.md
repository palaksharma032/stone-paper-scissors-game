# Stone, Paper, Scissors 

I built this as a way to practice Python fundamentals like logic handling, user input validation, and loops. 

Most simple versions of this game break if you make a typo or don't track the score properly, so I focused on making this version as smooth and "crash-proof" as possible.

## Why I Built This
This was a fun challenge to solve a few common coding problems:
- **The "Case" Problem:** Making sure "STONE" and "stone" both work.
- **Logic Handling:** Using clean `if/else` statements to determine a winner without dozens of lines of redundant code.
- **State Management:** Keeping a running tally of scores throughout a session.

## How It Works
The game is played entirely in your terminal. You'll see a simple menu where you can:
- Jump into a game.
- Check how many times you've beaten the computer.
- Reset everything if you're on a losing streak.
- Exit gracefully.

## Getting Started
If you have Python installed, you're ready to go.

1. Download `main.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt in that folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
